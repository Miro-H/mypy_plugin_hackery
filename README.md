# MyPy Hackery

A collection of tests with MyPy plugins that slightly abuse the Python type system to extend the syntax and add verifiers.

Examples:

| Name      | Short Description                                                             | Link                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| MyList    | Strongly typed list which can only be concatenated to lists of the same type. | [code](./examples/MyList/)    |
| Vector    | Custom vector class annotated with entry type and dimension.                  | [code](./examples/Vector/)    |

## Tests

Tests for the plugins will be added [here](./tests/).
